Welcome to the DirectPlugin library
===================================

This library has been created to facilitate the use of plugins like the DirectOutput framework for virtual pinball cabinets in hosting applications.

It provides the entire logic to detect, load and use plugins implementing the IDirectPlugin interface as defined in the DirectPluginInterface.dll.

For any questions regarding the integration and use of the library, please contact <a href="http://vpuniverse.com/forums/user/668-swisslizard/">SwissLizard</a>.

Enjoy (virtual) pinball and keep pinball alive!
