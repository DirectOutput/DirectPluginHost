#DirectPluginHost

This is the host code for plugins for the B2SServer. It uses the Microsofts Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) to detect, load and run the plugins.

This repository is only published for reference. If code changes are required, please make them in the B2S server.

Also, I havent touched this code since 2013 or so. Therefore dont expect me to remember any details on it and expect me to be slow to anser questions.
